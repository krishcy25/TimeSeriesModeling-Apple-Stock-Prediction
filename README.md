# TimeSeriesModeling-Apple-Stock-Prediction

This repository focuses on building Time Series Models (Recurrent Neural Networks-LSTM) to predict the Apple Stock. Model used train_data (apple_stock_complete_data) that contains history of apple stock from 1980's up untill June 2020. Jul 2020 Apple Stock data is used for validation. 


You can find the code in the Notebook "TimeSeriesModeling_RNN(LSTM).ipynb". The data files used in the code to train/validate the model is included in the repository.
